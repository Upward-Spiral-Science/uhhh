###Questions
D is our dataset, each with N<sub>i</sub> subjects, for i = 1...D.
Each N<sub>i</sub> consists of coordinates x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub> which correspond to a voxel in a particular image of a cortex; along with S_i which corresponds to the number of synapse contained in said 

**Descriptive**

1. Can we produce a 3D projection of the synapses using coordinates x_i, y_i, z_i for all voxels Ni in dataset D in order to visualize the density of synapses in the brain

**Exploratory**

1. Is there a distribution that fits the outlined density or is the distribution random
2. If so, what is it?

**Inferential**

**Predictive** 

**Causal**

**Mechanistic**
