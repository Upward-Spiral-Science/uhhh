###Questions
We have a dataset with N<sub>i</sub> 3D ponts, for i = 1...n.
Each N<sub>i</sub> consists of 5 attributes:
Three Coordinates x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub> labelled _cx_, _cy_, and _cz_. 
Some S<sub>i</sub>, where {S ∈ ℝ : S ≥ 0}, labelled _"synapses"_
Some U<sub>i</sub>, where {S ∈ ℝ : S ≥ 0}, labelled _"unmasked"_.

**Descriptive**

1. What does "unmasked" represent?
2. How can there be 
1. Can we produce a 3D projection of the synapses using coordinates x_i, y_i, z_i for all voxels Ni in dataset D in order to visualize the density of synapses in the brain

**Exploratory**

1. Is there a distribution that fits the outlined density or is the distribution random
2. If so, what is it?

**Inferential**

**Predictive** 

**Causal**

**Mechanistic**
