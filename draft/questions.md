D is our dataset, each with Ni subjects, for i = 1...i.
Each N_i consists of coordinates x_i, y_i, z_i which correspond to a voxel in a particular image of a cortex; along with S_i which corresponds to the number of synapse contained in said 

Descriptive

1. Can we produce a 3D projection of the synapses using coordinates x_i, y_i, z_i for all voxels Ni in dataset D in order to visualize the density of synapses in the brain

Exploratory

1. Is there a distribution that fits the outlined density or is the distribution random
2. If so, what is it?
