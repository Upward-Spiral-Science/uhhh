###Questions
We have a dataset with N<sub>i</sub> 3D ponts, for i = 1...n.
Each N<sub>i</sub> consists of coordinates x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub> representing a voxel's location in an imaged cortex section. Furthermore, each N<sub>i</sub> has a S<sub>i</sub>, where {S ∈ ℝ : S ≥ 0}, representing the number of synapses in the voxel, and U<sub>i</sub>, where {S ∈ ℝ : S ≥ 0}, representing some unknown "unmasked" attribute.

**Descriptive**

1. Can we produce a 3D projection of the synapses using coordinates x_i, y_i, z_i for all voxels Ni in dataset D in order to visualize the density of synapses in the brain

**Exploratory**

1. Is there a distribution that fits the outlined density or is the distribution random
2. If so, what is it?

**Inferential**

**Predictive** 

**Causal**

**Mechanistic**
